In this tutorial we will be building a responsive mobile first contact form using HTML and CSS. We will use CSS3 styling along with a bit of Grid CSS layout. Well also throw in some icons from font awesome and a simple entry animation using animate.css. This will be the front-end UI. We will implement the back end to capture the data in a later video.
